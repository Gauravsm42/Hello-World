# Hello-World
This is a repository I am using for learning Python from scratch.  
I had tried learning html and css 3 years ago. Got bored after couple months.  
This time I want to atleast be able to complete one small project. Hopefully, putting this out there online will help me stay on track.  
...  
Although, I doubt anyone will see this.
