# Hello-World
This is a repository I am using for learning Python from scratch.  
I had tried learning html and css 3 years ago. Got bored after couple months.  
This time I want to at least be able to complete one small project. Hopefully, putting this out there online will help me stay on track.  
...  
Although, I doubt anyone will see this.

Update [28/06]: Yeah... I fell off of this as well. Haven't gone back to this in a couple years. But NO FEAR, I've started learning R for Bioinformatics. Let's see, how long I stick to that!

Update [02/01/25]: R learning is going good. I've taken a break to restart with python, again for BioInfo.
